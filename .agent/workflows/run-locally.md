description: How to run the Chappan Bhog project locally
---

To run the Chappan Bhog website on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "d:\Chappan Bhog"
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the website**:
   Once the server starts, it will provide a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`). Click that link or paste it into your browser to view the site.

4. **Stop the server**:
   Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal when you're finished.
